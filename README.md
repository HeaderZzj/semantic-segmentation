# semantic-segmentation
Semantic Segmentation Implemented in PyTorch. Training on NYUD2 with reference to [meetshah1995's work](https://github.com/meetshah1995/pytorch-semseg)

Training dataset is an augmentation of [NYUD2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html). Each input image for training should consists of 6 channels(rgb + hha).
